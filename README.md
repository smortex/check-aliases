# check-aliases

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smortex/check-aliases.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smortex/check-aliases)

The `check-aliases` utility is intended to detect syntax errors in your
`/etc/aliases` file.  It was the consequence of a joke after accidentally
finding some errors in a rather big aliases file and reporting them to the
person in charge of this file: *Now please submit a parser that warns us for
each case, please 8-}*.
